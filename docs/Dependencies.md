## Numpy and Scipy

Mouette makes use of numpy and scipy for the representation of dense and sparse matrices.

## OSQP

OSQP ( Operator Splitting Quadratic Program ) is a quadratic programming algorithm supporting linear equalities and inequalities as constraints. Mouette relies on this solver for least-square problems when linear constraints are involved.
